Challenge Task(s)
-------

The following challenges will give you practice with _arrays_.  These challenges **could make use of** the pixels[] array.  For more information check out the [Pixels, pixels, and more pixels section of this page](https://processing.org/tutorials/pixels/)

1. Create a program that draws 100 circles to the screen of random colours with a strokeWeight of 1.  After drawing the 100 circles, search for any pixel on the screen that has a red value greater than 150, and draw a rectangle around the circles in order to highlight them.
2. Create a program that draws 100 circles with a partial transparency.  After drawing the 100 circles, search for any overlapping areas and display a count of the total amount of pixels in the overlapping areas.
3. Create a program that fills the screen with randomly sized rectangles that do not overlap, but fill the screen.  The maximum size of a rectangle is 1/5th of the screen size.  After drawing all the rectangles, search for any rectangles that are smaller than 50 pixels in width and display a count of the total when done.
