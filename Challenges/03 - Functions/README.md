Challenge Task(s)
-------

The following challenges will give you practice with _Functions_.  These go beyond void.

1. Generate a rectangle on the screen, with one corner being at ```(mouseX, mouseY)```.  Create a function that calculates the perimeter around that rectangle, and returns the answer as a float.  Display that information on the screen.  The function should update the answer as you move the mouse.

2. Generate 4 different-coloured rectangles that have one of their points meet at mouseX, mouseY.  Have the areas of all 4 rectangles display on the screen.  Use a function to calculate the area and return that information to the ```text()``` function.

3. Create a screen that is equal in width and height.  Generate a rectangle on the screen centred both vertically and horizontally that is half the width (or height) of the screen.  Generate a circle that is also centred on the screen.  As you move your mouse, your circle should grow and shrink relative to the mouse position.  The diameter should have a maximum value equal to 1/2 the width (or height) of your screen.  Create a function that calculates the visible portion of the rectangle and returns that information to the ```text()``` function.
