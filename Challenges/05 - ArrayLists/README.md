Challenge Task(s)
-------

The following challenges will give you practice with _ArrayLists_.  These challenges use _PVectors_ as well.  For more information check out the [following](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-1-vectors/) up to, and including, section 1.6.

1. Create a program that draws perpendicular vectors based on where you clicked the mouse.  For example if I click at position (50, 50), and then at position (100, 50) there would be a vector drawn at (75, 75) to (75, 125).  Store all of these vectors in an ArrayList.  On a particular key press, the program should draw all of the perpendicular vectors stored with random colors and triangles at the end points of the vectors to show direction.
2. Create a program with 50 moving circles.  The program should also draw vectors in the opposite direction of which the circle is moving, with a length equal to the speed of the circle.  Store all of these vectors in an ArrayList.  Set a key to toggle whether to show the vectors or not (include arrow-heads to show the direction of the vectors).
3. Create a program with 20 moving rectangles of 10 different colors.  Each pair of colour-matching rectangles should have vectors pointing at each other, of a length that is double the width of the rectangles.  If the rectangles come within range of each other's vector distance, the vectors should be removed permanently, and the rectangles should turn white.  Have a key press available to restart your program.
