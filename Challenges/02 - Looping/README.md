Challenge Task(s)
-------

The following challenges will give you practice with _for loops_

1. Create a program that draws 100 circles to the screen of random colours.
2. Create a program that draws 100 triangles, where each new triangle is connected to the previous triangle on 1 point.
3. Create a program that fills the screen with randomly sized rectangles that do not overlap, but fill the screen.  The maximum size of a rectangle is 1/15th of the screen size.
4. Create a program that draws between 80 and 120 points (randomly chosen) to the screen.  Have the program connect the dots using lines; however, you can only generate non-overlapping triangles.
