**The culminating is worth 20% of your final mark.  The remaining 10% will be the exam.**

Task(s)
-------
1. Create one of the following:
  1. A simulated screensaver (easy)
  2. A simulated Eco-system (hard)
2. Gallery walk
3. Complete a 1-page reflection of the process.

Eco-System Criteria
--------
1. Write down your brainstorming/planning in a document of some sort
2. Create a flowchart before coding your project.  **If you have started programming and do not have a supporting flowchart, you will be required to start over with a new idea.**
3. Use ```size(displayWidth, displayHeight)``` for the size of your window when finished (can use smaller for testing)
4. The program will run in full screen mode (use Ctrl+Shift+R during testing).
5. Your program must be able to run on it's own when you hit the play button.
6. Your program must have an interactivity part with the mouse or keyboard (**must** also work **without** user input)
7. Your program must include the following concepts:
  * If statements
  * Looping
  * Functions
  * PVectors
  * Objects
8. Your program **cannot** be similar to any previous assignments or exercises (either from this year, or through the mrseidel.com archives)


Gallery Walk
------------
How will the gallery walk work?
* At the begining of class on June 17th, 2016 you are going to log in and run your program.  
* The program should run on its own.
* Print out a sheet with instructions for the interactivity of your program
  * Leave that sheet by your computer as your program runs

Reflection Criteria
---------
Using a word processor, write a maximum of 1-page (11-12 sized font), include answers to **at least** the following questions:

1. What would you do differently if you had to do this assignment over again?
2. What would you do to your program if you had another month to work on it?
3. What difficulties and challenges did you encounter?
4. During your gallery walk, were you impressed by any of the screensavers (other than your own)? If so, which one and why?  If not, choose one of them that you saw and describe how you would change it if you were the programmer.

Submissables
------------
Hand in your program and reflection to the IN drive.

Due Date(s)
----------
* Program due June 16th, 2016 by 2:46pm
* A gallery walk will be completed at the beginning of class on June 17th, 2016 to show off everyone's program.
* Reflection due by June 17th, 2016 by 2:46pm

Rubric(s)
---------
**These rubrics total to 36**

**Programming Rubric ( /32)**

| | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1: Can effectively use different data types (i.e. float, int, boolean, PVector, etc.), including one-dimensional arrays/ArrayLists | | | | | |
| A2: Can effectively use control structures (i.e. if statements, loops, etc.) and simple algorithms | | | | | |
| A3: Can effectively use subprograms (i.e. built-in functions, and custom functions) and encapsulation (i.e. classes and objects) | | | | | |
| A4: Can effectively use proper code maintenance techniques (commenting, indenting, file naming, etc.) and conventions (camelCase or pot_hole_case consistency, variable naming, class naming, etc.) | | | | | |
| B2: Can effectively design software solutions to meet the challenge (e.g. is a viable eco-system, effectiveness of visual, etc.) | | | | | |
| B3: Can effectively design algorithms to meet the challenge | | | | | |
| B4: Can effectively apply a software development life cycle to the project (have brainstorming and planning written down, have a flowchart for the program before coding, create and test the program, complete the gallery walk) | | | | | |
| C3: Can effectively understand the software development process (using the Processing editor, working independently using documentation, manuals, and websites, etc.) | | | | | |


**Reflection Rubric ( /4)**

| | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
