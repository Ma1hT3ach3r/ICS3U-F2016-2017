Task(s)
-------
You **may** complete this task in pairs, or on your own.

* Using your knowledge of programming, PVectors, functions, if statements, loops, arrays (or ArrayLists), and objects you will complete either *Option A* or *Option B* below:

###Option A (if completing in pairs)

* Recreate the sketch found in OUT\SEIDEL\ICS3U\Assign4 based on the following criteria:
  * Must use classes and objects (correctly) for your points
  * Must use PVectors (correctly) within your class/object used for points
  * Your line distance is calculated in real-time (i.e. also while dragging a circle around)
  * When inserting a new circle, the lines will adjust to ensure a closed polygon.
  * Your circles cannot overlap (except while dragging one around).
  * The colors of the circles in the videos relate as follows:
    * Red means your mouse is over a circle
    * Purple means you are dragging a particular circle

* A maximum mark of level 3 is available if you are able to complete up to calculating line distance
* A maximum mark of level 4 is available if you are able to emulate the entire video, and all concepts therein
* Because this is a pair option, each person will be interviewed individually to ensure understanding of all concepts above.  There is no guarantee that both students will obtain the same mark, nor same maximum level option above.

###Option B (if completing alone)

* Create a simulation of a real-life event, or real-world phenomenon (excluding any that we have done (or is similar to) in class previously - i.e. you can't do **just** gravity as in the Rock example, etc.).  Your simulation must have the following:
  * Must be cleared by your teacher prior to beginning your coding
  * Uses classes and objects (correctly)
  * Uses PVectors (correctly), preferably within your classes/objects
  * Must be more than 1-dimensional (i.e. can't just have a ball bouncing that slowly bounces less and less)
  * When you click on the screen, something occurs to the objects on the screen
  * Must apply a formula based on the dynamic information produced when you click on the screen, or based on the motion of an object.  This information needs to be displayed to the screen
  * Must have something moving (or trying to) on the screen, based on an as-accurate-as-you-can model (if excluding factors such as friction or wind resistance, note that in a comment in your program)
  * Must include a visual representation of the PVectors (direction, length, etc.) as something moves above the screen (or tries to).

* A maximum mark of level 3 is available if you complete up to and including the formula portion
* A maximum mark of level 4 is available if you accurately include all requirements above with accuracy and purpose
