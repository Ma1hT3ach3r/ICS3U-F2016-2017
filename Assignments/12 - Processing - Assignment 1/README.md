Task(s)
-------
You are to complete this task on your own (i.e. no group submissions, or no plagiarizing from each other (or internet), etc.)
* Using your knowledge of programming and if statements you will recreate the sketch found in the OUT\Seidel\ICS3U\Assignment 1 folder
* You can use only **arc()** for the **moving** shapes.  _Hint: You can use stroke to your advantage to create a "circle" at the end of an arc_
* You are **not** allowed to use translate(), rotate(), pushMatrix(), or popMatrix() - (**exception**: you can use translate(width/2, height/2) to place your origin in the center of the screen)


Submissables
------------
Do **not** hand this work in - your teacher will mark this at your computer near the due date.


Due Date(s)
----------
Marking will begin at the beginning of class on November 2nd.
