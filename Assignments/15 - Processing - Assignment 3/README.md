Task(s)
-------
You are to complete this task on your own (i.e. no group submissions, or no plagiarizing from each other (or internet), etc.)
* Using your knowledge of programming, PVectors, functions, if statements, loops, and arrays you will complete either *Option A* or *Option B* below:

###Option A
Recreate the sketch found in the OUT\SEIDEL\ICS3U\Assign3 folder
* You are required to have the following in your code:
  1. PVectors to hold your point information
  2. Your PVectors must be in an array
  3. When you click the mouse, it creates or moves a point on the screen to the newly clicked position.
  4. After 3 points are on the screen, you are to calculate the area of the triangle drawn (shown in video), and perimeter (not shown in video).

* A maximum mark of level 3 is available if you do not include the area and perimeter calculation.
* A maximum mark of level 4 is available if you include accurate area and perimeter calculations.

###Option B
* Create a simulation of a chemistry or biology concept.  Your simulation must have the following:
  * Uses PVectors.
  * Uses arrays.
  * When you click on the screen, something either gets added to or subtracted from the screen.
  * Must apply a formula, or align properly (such as chain diagrams in chemistry) based on the dynamic information produced when you click on the screen.  This information needs to be displayed to the screen.

* A maximum mark of level 3 is available if you do not include calculations or alignment information.
* A maximum mark of level 4 is available if you accurately include calculations and alignment information
