  1. Create a simple Kirby object that will display different actions depending on what key is pressed on the keyboard (within the Kirby object):
  2. Create a sketch that implements 3 basic actions, 2 attack actions, 1 idle expression, and 1 spin move
    *Use A, S, and D for the basic actions; G, H for the attack actions; K for the spin move; and when nothing is pressed the idle expression animates
  3. Use the letter 'M' on the keyboard to toggle Kirby so that he faces left or right when pressed
