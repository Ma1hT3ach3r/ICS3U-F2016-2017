Task(s)
-------
* Using your knowledge of programming and objects and ArrayLists you will recreate the sketch found 
here: [here](http://youtu.be/QuscjhE4OiQ?hd=1) 
* The sketch contains the following elements: 
  1. A gridded background made up of rectangles 
  2. When you click the mouse, 10 Circle Objects are generated of various sizes, unless there are 
already 50+ of them on the screen. 
  3. One circle object can act as a “light source” 
  4. When you press the “C” key on the keyboard the following happens: 
    a. All Circle objects disappear 
    b. A new light source is generated 
    c. The grid size is changed 
    d. New Circle object are created in the foreground again (see below for more details) 
  5. When you press the “L” key the Circle objects go into the background, lose their colour and can 
only be seen when the light source (which keeps it’s colour) passes by. 
  6. When you press the “L” key again, it brings the Circle objects back into the foreground, regain 
their original colours and can be seen again regardless of the light source
