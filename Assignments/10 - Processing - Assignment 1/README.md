Task(s)
-------
* Using your knowledge of programming and if statements you will recreate the sketch found [here] (http://youtu.be/IOX9HbOh1Gw?hd=1)
* The entire sketch is to be completed using only **arc()** and **ellipse()** for your shapes.  For the blue dot, you can use a **point()** instead
* The blue dot is considered a bonus for this assignment.  The blue dot's behaviour is sporadic, but it is bound within the middle circle and cannot escape
