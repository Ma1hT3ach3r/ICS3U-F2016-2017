Task(s)
-------
* Using your knowledge of programming, PVectors and arrays you will recreate the sketch found 
at OUT\SEIDEL\ICS3U\Assign3
* You are required to have the following in your code:
  1. PVectors (3 of them) to hold your point information
  2. Your PVectors must be in an array
  3. When you click the mouse, it creates (if less than 3 points) or moves a point on the screen to the newly clicked position.
  4. After 3 points are on the screen, you are to calculate the area of the triangle drawn.  Use the attached template for the basic structure of your functions.  You will have to look up how to calculate the area of a triangle given 3 points.

Submissables
------------
Hand in a copy of your work to the IN\SEIDEL\ICS3U\Assign3 folder - your teacher will mark this at your computer near the due date.

Due Date(s)
----------
Due by April 15th - **no exceptions**
