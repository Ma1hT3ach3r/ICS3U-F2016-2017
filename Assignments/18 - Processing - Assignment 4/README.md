Task(s)
-------
**CHOOSE TO COMPLETE ONLY ONE OF THE VIDEOS**

* Using your knowledge of programming (Objects and anything prior) you will recreate **one** of the sketches found at OUT\SEIDEL\ICS3U\Assign4

* If you choose the one that has both circles and squares, then you are required to have the following in your code:
  1. Class for circles and a class for squares
  2. PVectors to hold your position information within the objects
  3. Arrays (or ArrayLists) for your various objects within the "main" tab
  4. All shapes must fade, and all rectangle must rotate upon themselves.

* If you choose to one that is similar to Assignment 3, then you are required to have the following in your code (this is the more challenging and complex choice):
  1. Class for Points, and you might find having a Polygon class helpful
  2. PVectors to hold your position information within your Point class
  3. When inserting a new circle, the lines will adjust to ensure a closed polygon.
  4. Your circles cannot overlap (except while dragging one around).
  5. Your line distance is calculated real-time.
  6. The colors of the circles relate as follows:
    * Red means your mouse is over the Point object
    * Purple means you are dragging this Point object around


Submissables
